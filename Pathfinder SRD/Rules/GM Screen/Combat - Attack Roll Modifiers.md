<sup>1</sup> An entangled character also takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity, which may affect his attack roll.  
<sup>2</sup> The defender loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.  
<sup>3</sup> Most ranged weapons can’t be used while the attacker is prone, but you can use a crossbow or shuriken while prone at no penalty.
